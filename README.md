# Steal-a-system
This took about 3 days to a week due to some problems, fully made in Knit, very customizable, available for public usage but not recommended to use in future games.

It works very well but has not been **battle-tested** or tested for bugs in any kind of way, its just for showcase, snippets and how I use knit.

I will not provide any documentation whatsoever, its very easy to use you just need **basic knowledge** to modify it.

!! I may include long-term memory leaks, I personally doubt !!

I highly vouch the idea the other reviewers said, its a very advanced system that just needs to be tested before pushed to production games. Even tho the trend is going to get smoked, I'd say this is also a great point of learning from newbies; I have tried to keep the code very clean this time...

Framework: Knit;
